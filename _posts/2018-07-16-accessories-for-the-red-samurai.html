<p><strong>Artisan keycaps:</strong> Last week, keycap samples have been sent to two makers on Geekhack and <!--more-->I have given them permission to create artisans in the Red Samurai colorway. These might be available for sale a few months from now (date unconfirmed) for a limited time in a raffle and in a very limited quantity, which means not everyone will be able to purchase one. They will probably run in their typical price ranges on Geekhack in the <a href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?board=160.0" target="_blank">Artisan Services</a> forum. Maker names will be revealed when dates are confirmed. Other artisan makers are free to contact me about artisans in the colorway, though I do not have any more extra samples to send out.</p>
<p><strong>Custom Desk Mat:</strong> I have not decided whether or not I will offer this. Still planning a design.</p>
<p><strong>Custom USB cables:</strong> You can design your own Mechcables USB cable to match the keycap set using the form at <a href="http://mechcables.com" target="_blank">mechcables.com</a></p>
<br />
<p>Please note that any information you provide will be handled by the makers themselves.</p>
<p>More information will be provided at a later time.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please contact me at redsunsrmk[at]gmail.com</p>
