<p><strong>Artisan keycaps:</strong> Last week, keycap samples have been sent to two makers on GeekHack and <!--more-->I have given them permission to create artisans in the "Red Samurai" colorway. These might be available for sale a few months from now (date unconfirmed) for a limited time in a raffle sale and in a very limited quantity, which means not everyone can purchase one. They will probably run in their typical price ranges on GeekHack in the <a href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?board=160.0" target="_blank">Artisan Services</a> forum. Please do not spam random maker inboxes if you would like this to happen. Other artisan makers are free to contact me about artisans in the colorway, however, I do not have any more extra samples to send out.</p>
<p><strong>Desk Mat:</strong> I have not decided whether or not I will make these available. Still in design planning stage.</p>
<p><strong>USB cables:</strong> You can design your own cable to match the keycap set using the form at <a href="http://mechcables.com" target="_blank">mechcables.com</a></p>
<br />
<p>Please note that any information you provide will be handled by the makers themselves. Using PayPal is advised. Buy at your own risk.</p>
<p>More information will be provided at a later time.</p>
